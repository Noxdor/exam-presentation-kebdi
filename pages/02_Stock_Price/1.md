The goal was to follow along the
[Google Stock Price with RNN vs LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/code/angeloruggieridj/google-stock-price-with-rnn-vs-lstm/notebook)
analysis inside the Jupyter Notebook on kaggle and understand the theory and code provided.
A self-created variant of the Notebook with small adjustments and self-generated results
can be found as an export [here](https://lennart.guderian.de/stock-rnn/) (Again linked at
the end of this chapter).

But first, the following slides contain a short summary of the needed theory to understand
neural networks in general and RNNs and LSTMs (an advanced version of an RNN) specifically.

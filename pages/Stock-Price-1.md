The goal was to follow along the
[Google Stock Price with RNN vs LSTM](https://www.kaggle.com/code/angeloruggieridj/google-stock-price-with-rnn-vs-lstm/notebook)
Analysis inside the Jupyter Notebook on kaggle and understand the theory and code provided.
I also followed along in my own Notebook with small adjustments, the export of my
results can be found at the end of this chapter.

But first, the following slides contain a short summary of the needed theory to understand
Neural Networks in general and RNNs and LSTMs (an advanced version of a RNN) specifically.

# Semantic Web and Prolog

The goal of this part of the exam was to solve tasks regarding the principles
and technologies behind the concept of the **Semantic Web**. Specifically questions and
tasks regarding the **Web Ontology Language (OWL)** and a with it implemented ontology
had to be solved. In the next step, the ontology was queried with **SPARQL**, a query 
language for the distributed graph database that is the Semantic Web. Three rules
with the **Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)** had to be defined to extend
the given ontology with. Finally, this chapter contains some tasks regarding the
logical programming language **Prolog** as well as **Natural Language Processing** with
Python and the Spacy library.

The [Irrigation ontology for experimentation in TSCF](https://irstea.github.io/irrig/OnToology/ontology/irrig.owl/documentation/index-en.html#https://w3id.org/def/saref4agri#WateringValve)
is an ontology designed to make elements available that can be used to model
and record objects and measurement values from the field of agriculture, forming
a base for the development of a "Smart Agriculture" world.

It constitutes four main types of definitions (so standardised by OWL):
1. Classes, e.g. `saref4agri:WateringValve`
2. Object Properties, with a single property `prov:wasDerivedFrom`
3. Data Properties, e.g. `saref:hasManufacturer`
4. Individuals, e.g. `irrig:actuator_wateringValve_01`

The next pages are going to go into more details on these four types of definitions.

## Classes

Each class is used to define a specific concept from agriculture in general or 
plant aggregation specifically. Classes are used to keep individuals with
same or similar characteristics under one classification. **Subclasses**
are classes that are sub-classifications of a class. They are even more specific.
Drawing a Venn-Diagram, they would form a smaller circle inside a bigger circle 
forming the class.
One of the classes used in this ontology is the class [Actuator](https://ontology.tno.nl/saref/#Actuator).
It is not directly part of the ontology, but is imported from the SAREF (Smart Appliances REFerence) ontology.
One (sub)class that is directly part of the irrigation ontology is the **WateringValve**. It
is a subclass of [Actuator](https://ontology.tno.nl/saref/#Actuator) and defined like this:

```xml
<owl:Class rdf:about="https://w3id.org/def/saref4agri#WateringValve">
    <rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="https://w3id.org/saref#Actuator"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">An actuator that open the water valve.</rdfs:comment>
    <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Watering Valve</rdfs:label>
</owl:Class>
```

## Properties

Properties provide information that is being attached to instances (called individuals) of classes.
This is contrary to how they work in object oriented programming and are not to be confused
with that concept. While in object oriented programming, properties are attached to the
class and can be accessed either on the class (`static`) or on the instance, OWL classes
don't have properties attached to them. Properties are only attached to individuals. That means,
they are defined separately from classes and individuals. Then they can be attached to individuals,
even if these individuals are instances of different classes.

There are two types of properties:
1. Object Properties
2. Datatype Properties (also Data Properties)

While **Object Properties** relate individuals of two OWL classes (same or different),
**Datatype Properties** relate individuals of OWL classes to literal values.

The single **Object Property** defined in this ontology is `wasDerivedFrom`. It is defined like this:

```xml
<owl:ObjectProperty rdf:about="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasDerivedFrom">
    <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#wasInfluencedBy"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A derivation is a transformation of an entity into another, an update of an
    entity resulting in a new one, or the construction of a new entity based on a pre-existing entity.</rdfs:comment>
    <rdfs:label>wasDerivedFrom</rdfs:label>
</owl:ObjectProperty>
```

This is used for example to connect observations defined with the **RainDailyTotalQuantityObservation**
class to a measurement device.

One of the three **Datatype Properties** is `hasManufacturer`. Its definition is straight forward:

```xml
<owl:DatatypeProperty rdf:about="https://w3id.org/saref#hasManufacturer">
    <rdfs:range rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"/>
    <rdfs:comment>A relationship identifying the manufacturer of an entity (e.g., device)</rdfs:comment>
    <rdfs:label>has manufacturer</rdfs:label>
</owl:DatatypeProperty>
```

It has a range ("type") of string, which can be assigned to device entities to specify which company produced
the device.

## Individuals

As mentioned when talking about classes, individuals are entities of a class.
For example, the individual `actuator_wateringValve_01` links to information about an actual
valve that is actuating a specific water stream. It is an individual of the class
`WateringValve` which again is a subclass of `Actuator`. The developers of this ontology decided
to reflect this in the name, having both "actuator" and "wateringValve" as part of the name of this individual.

```xml
<owl:NamedIndividual rdf:about="http://www.w3id.org/def/irrig#actuator_wateringValve_1">
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="https://w3id.org/def/saref4agri#WateringValve"/>
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Actuator_wateringValve_1 - An actuator nÂ°1 that controls the valve of water.</rdfs:comment>
    <rdfs:label>Actuator Watering  Valve 01 Soil Moisture</rdfs:label>
</owl:NamedIndividual>
```

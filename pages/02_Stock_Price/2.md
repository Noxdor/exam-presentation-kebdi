> How to fire the nodes ("neurones") in the next layer, depending on the biases, activations and weights of
the nodes in the previous layer

The excitation $e$ of the next node is calculated like this: $e = \sum w_i \times a_i + b$

The activation function is a function taking $e$ (the excitation of the node) and mapping it onto
an activation of the node in the next layer.

Different activation functions have ups an downs when it comes to the data the model is trained on.
The most used activation function used to be the **Sigmoid** function, since it models the behaviour
of a real neuron in our brains, which made researchers think it might be the best option for artifical
network activation. Over time, other functions were tested out, with **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit)
becoming the most widely used today. **Tanh** is another way to model activation, which was used alongside
ReLU here as an activation function.

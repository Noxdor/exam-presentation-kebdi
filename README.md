## Course **Knowledge Engineering and Big Data Intelligence**

taken by Lennart Guderian at Università degli Studi della Campania _Luigi Vanvitelli_ as a guest student, home university is
Technische Universität Dresden.

This project contains the source code to the pdf document created as an elaboration on the tasks given for the courses exam. They
were created with [Slidev](https://github.com/slidevjs/slidev) and mainly written in Markdown.

This project also contains some of the source code created for solving the tasks of the exam. The rest of the source code, mainly the source code
to the last project of implementing the A*-Algorithm, can be found [here](https://github.com/Noxdor/wasm-astar) or in the exported PDF file.

The PDF can be created by running `npm run export`. You can then find it in the `export` folder. You can look at the pages in the browser and see direct updates to them by running `npm run dev`. This will start a development server (Vite) to look at the pages inside the browser and see live updates during development.

## Domain, Range and Restrictions


---
---

The object properties have added domain and range specification to allow
inference. For example:

<div class="flex items-center justify-center gap-8">
  <img src="/images/protege/Domain_Range_1.png" />
  <img src="/images/protege/Domain_Range_2.png" />
  <img src="/images/protege/Domain_Range_3.png" />
</div>

<style>
img {
  height: 350px;
}
</style>

---

The `Watering Valve` class has an added `has_Value` restriction.

---

The `Device` class has a restricted cardinality of the `stands next to` object property
of 4. This means, each `Device` can have at maximum four neighbours (for each cardinal direction).

## Object Relations

**Transitivity**: If a property $P$ is transitive and connects individual $a$ with $b$,
as well as $b$ with $c$, it can be inferred that it also connects $a$ with $c$.<br/>
Example: If the individuals are days and $a$ is a previous day of $b$, $b$ is a previous day of
$c$ it can be deduced that $a$ is a previous day of $c$.

**Symmetry**: If a property $P$ is symmetric and connects individual $a$ with $b$, it can be 
inferred that property $P$ also connects individual $b$ with $a$.<br/>
Example: The created object property `stands_next_to`. If a device $a$ stands next to a device $b$,
the same can be said in about the relation in the other direction.

**Functionality**: Only one individual $b$ can be connected via a functional property $P$ with an
individual $a$. If $a$ is also connected to $c$ via $P$, it can be deduced that $c$ and
$b$ are the same individual.<br/>
Example: The author of this document is currently living in _Napoli_.
Talking to his family at home, he would state he is living in _Neapel_. Knowing that the
property "living in" is functional (a person can only live at one place at the same time),
we can deduce that _Napoli_ and _Neapel_ refer to the same place.

**Inverse Functionality**: It is the inverse of the functionality rule for properties connecting
$b$ with $a$ in the description above. From an inverse property that is functional follows
a property that is inverse functional.
Example: Simply changing "living in" to "is current location of" in the example above results in
an inversely functional property.

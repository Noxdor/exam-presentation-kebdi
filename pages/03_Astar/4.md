N. **Functionality**: Description (Key Shortcut)

1. **Add**: Add node to graph (<kbd>a</kbd>)
2. **Remove**: Remove node or edge from graph (<kbd>r</kbd>)
3. **Select Start**: Select start node \[required for **Solve**\] (<kbd>s</kbd>)
4. **Select Target**: Select target node (<kbd>t</kbd>) \[required for **Connect**\]
> Once the target node is selected, each node shows as a red number
> in the bottom of the node its calculated heuristic.
5. **Connect**: Connect two nodes. Opens a window to insert actual edge weight. (<kbd>c</kbd>)
6. **Solve**: Solve the graph with A\*. If a path was found, it is visually highlighted in the graph.
If not, message will appear stating that there is no connecting path. (<kbd>Spacebar</kbd>)
7. **Move**: Move the position on the canvas by dragging with the mouse. Either by keeping <kbd>Shift</kbd>
pressed or by clicking the hand icon on the right.
8. **Zoom**: Zoom in and out by scrolling with the mouse wheel or with two fingers on a touch pad, by clicking

## Saving and restoring graphs

---
layout: center
class: "text-justify"
---

Graphs can be either saved locally and restored from a list of locally stored graphs,
or exported as a `json` file and loaded back into the application on any machine worldwide.

1. Clicking **Save Graph** saves the currently opened graph locally with the name provided in
the navbar on top (Default: "New Graph").
2. Clicking **Load Graph** opens a list of all locally saved graphs with a timestamp from when
it was saved. Entries can loaded and deleted individually or deleted all at once.
3. Clicking **Export Graph** exports the graph as a `json` file, saving all nodes, connections,
start and target node as well as the last found path.
4. Clicking **Import Graph** imports the graph contained in a previously exported `json` file, loading
all things mentioned under 3.
